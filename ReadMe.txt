Some noteworthy elements of the program are the functions created to clean, format and store data, minimising the amount of code needed thus enhancing efficiency and reusability. For reproducibility, the random numbers generated were seeded using numpy.random.seed(3). Finally, in the 'modify' section of the code, a warning showing that a value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a dataframe appears, but this does not affect the overall results of the code. The program still executes as expected.
